								<p>Our club is a competitive swimming club. That means we enter lots of competitions, commonly known as galas or meets. Lots of swimming clubs host galas for other clubs to enter (an 'open' meet). They are great opportunities for the swimmers to use and enhance their skills, and they can be a lot of fun.</p>
								<p>Swimmers in competitive squads are expected to enter individual (open) galas on a regular basis.</p>
								<p>Most galas are licensed events. That means that they are run to a standard dictated by the ASA, and that any race times achieved at that gala is considered official.</p>
								<p>All gala have age and time restrictions so you need to carefully read the entry conditions.</p>
								<p>For most galas, you need to be ASA Category 2 registered.</p>
								<p>We are always looking for officials, time-keepers and poolside helpers.</p>
